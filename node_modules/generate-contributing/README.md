## Getting started

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `readme` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate][] globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install generate-contributing**

Install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-contributing
```

### CLI

Run this generator's `default` [task](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#default) with the following command:

```sh
$ gen readme
```

**What you should see in the terminal**

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).

### Help

To see a general help menu and available commands for Generate's CLI, run:

```sh
$ gen help
```

## Available tasks

All available tasks for this generator.

### [contributing](generator.js#L26)

Generate an `issue_template.md` file to the `.github/` directory, or specified `--dest`.

**Example**

```sh
$ gen contributing:it
$ gen contributing:it --dest ./docs
# also aliased as the following (mostly for API usage)
$ gen contributing:issue_template
```

### [contributing:itb](generator.js#L59)

Generate a bare bones `issue_template.md` file to the `.github/` directory, or specified `--dest`. Uses [this template](templates/issue_template_basic.md).

**Example**

```sh
$ gen contributing:itb
$ gen contributing:itb --dest ./docs
# also aliased as the following (mostly for API usage)
$ gen contributing:issue_template_detailed
```

### [contributing:itd](generator.js#L76)

Generate a detailed `issue_template.md` file to the `.github/` directory, or specified `--dest`. Uses [this template](templates/issue_template_detailed.md)

**Example**

```sh
$ gen contributing:itd
$ gen contributing:itd --dest ./docs
# also aliased as the following (mostly for API usage)
$ gen contributing:issue_template_detailed
```

### [contributing:pr](generator.js#L93)

**Example**

```sh
$ gen contributing:prd
$ gen contributing:prd --dest ./docs
# also aliased as the following (for API usage, when it helps to be explicit in code)
$ gen contributing:pr_template_detailed
```

## Next steps

### Running unit tests

It's never too early to begin running unit tests. When you're ready to get started, the following command will ensure the project's dependencies are installed then run all of the unit tests:

```sh
$ npm install && test
```

### Publishing your generator

If you're tests are passing and you're ready to publish your generator to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), you can do that now with the following command:

**Are you sure you're ready?!**

Let's go!

```sh
$ npm publish
```

## About

### What is "Generate"?

Generate is a command line tool and developer framework for scaffolding out new GitHub projects using [generators](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/generators.md) and [tasks](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md).

Answers to prompts and the user's environment can be used to determine the templates, directories, files and contents to build. Support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins, and much more.
